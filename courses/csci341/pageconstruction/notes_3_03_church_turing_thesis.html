<h1>The Church-Turing Thesis</h1>

<p>
    Last time, we saw Turing machines, our first honest-to-goodness full-scale mathematical model of computer hardware. 
    But why did we define it the way we did? 
    We had to make some choices about the design, right?
    And what's more, we seemed to go beyond what's normally represented by actual physical hardware: our definition allowed us to go beyond  \(0\)s and \(1\)s and write arbitrary symbols to our memory.
    That's not good, right? Why can't we just use \(0\) and \(1\)?
</p>

<p>
    Today, we are going to see that none of these choices matter in the end: no matter which "versions" of the Turing machine concept we choose, the same string transformers are computable.
    In fact, it is thought that <i>any</i> physically implementable model of computation that is at least as <i>expressive</i> (in the precise sense we will define below) as the Turing machine model is actually <i>equivalent</i> to the basic Turing machine model.
    This is what is known as the <i>Church-Turing Thesis</i>, which we will state more precisely at the end of today.
</p>

<p>
    Today, we're going to make our way through a couple of different variations on the Turing machine theme, and show that they are all equivalent to the basic version of the Turing machine that we considered last time.
    More precisely:

<div class="definition">
    <b>(Turing Complete)</b>
    Let \(A\) and \(B\) be any two alphabets of tape symbols, and let \(\mathsf{Comp} = \{g \colon A^* \rightharpoonup A^*\}\) 
    and \(T\) be any set of string transformers \(A^* \rightharpoonup A^*\). 
    We say that \(T\) is <i>Turing complete</i> if

    As our first example, let's argue that we can always
