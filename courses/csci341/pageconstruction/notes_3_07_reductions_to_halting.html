<h1>Undecidability via the Halting Problem</h1>

<p>
    The undecidability of the Halting problem has many severe consequences!
    In a previous lecture, we already briefly talked about "reductions", where we were able to solve a problem \(P_1\) using a pre-existing solution to \(P_2\), i.e., we <i>reduced \(P_1\) to \(P_2\)</i>.
    Many other languages (decision problems) can be shown to be undecidable by reducing them to the halting problem.
</p>

<div class="example">
    <b>(Halting on the Empty Word)</b>
    Consider the language below, called the <i>halt-on-empty language</i>:
    \[
        L_{\varepsilon Halt} = \{\lfloor \mathcal T\rfloor \mathtt{*x} \mid \text{Turing machine \(\mathcal T\) at state \(x\) halts on input \(\varepsilon\)}\}
    \]
    What we are going to prove is the following statement: <i>if \(L_{\varepsilon Halt}\) is decidable, then \(L_{Halt}\) is undecidable</i>. 
    Let's see how this works: suppose for a contradiction that \(\mathcal E\) is a Turing machine with a state \(x_\varepsilon\) that decides the language \(L_{\varepsilon Halt}\).
    We are going show how to use \(\mathcal E\) to design a Turing machine \(\mathcal H\) with a state \(x_{hlt}\) that decides \(L_{Halt}\).
    
    <p></p>
    Unlike the halt-on-empty problem, the input to the ordinary halting problem includes an input string in addition to the encoding of the Turing machine and state name.
    The general idea behind the construction is to take a string of the form \(\lfloor \mathcal T \rfloor \mathtt{*x*}w\) and add to \(\lfloor T \rfloor\) a string of code that represents some states that write \(w\) to its tape.
    Specifically, let \(\mathcal W\) with state \(y_{write}\) be a Turing program that satisfies 
    \[\begin{aligned}
        &\mathcal W_{y_{write}}(u \mathtt{*} x \mathtt{*} a_1a_2\cdots a_n) \\
        &= \mathtt{state\# x_{new} {/} write\# a_1.write\# a_2\dots write\# a_n.goto\# x{/}}u\mathtt{*x_{new}}
    \end{aligned}\]
    Then we can directly define \(\mathcal H\) and \(x_{hlt}\) by setting 
    \[
        \mathcal H_{x_{hlt}} ( w ) 
        = \mathcal E_{x_{\varepsilon}} (\mathcal W_{y_{write}} ( w ))
    \]
    By composing, we obtain the following:
    \[\begin{aligned}
        &\mathcal H_{x_{hlt}}(\lfloor \mathcal T \rfloor \mathtt{*x*}w) \\
        &= \mathcal E_{x_{\varepsilon}}\big( \mathcal W_{y_{write}}(\lfloor \mathcal T \rfloor \mathtt{*x*}w) \big) \\
        &= \mathcal E_{x_{\varepsilon}}\big( \mathtt{state\# x_{new} {/} write\# a_1.write\# a_2\dots write\# a_n.goto\# x{/}} \lfloor \mathcal T \rfloor \mathtt{*x_{new}} \big) \\
    \end{aligned}\]
    Since \(\mathcal E\) at \(x_{\varepsilon}\) decides \(L_{\varepsilon Halt}\), this shows us that \(\mathcal H_{x_{hlt}}(\lfloor \mathcal T \rfloor \mathtt{*x*}w) = 1\) if \(x\) in \(\mathcal T\) halts on input \(w\), and \(\mathcal H_{x_{hlt}}(\lfloor \mathcal T \rfloor \mathtt{*x*}w) = 0\) if \(x\) in \(\mathcal T\) does not halt on input \(w\).
    In other words, \(\mathcal H\) at \(x_{hlt}\) is a decider for the halting problem, which does not exist.
    It follows that \(L_{\varepsilon Halt}\) is undecidable.

    The rest of this lecture is just a list of undecidable/unrecognizable problems!

<div class="problem">
    <b>(Getting Even)</b>
    Let \[
        L = \big\{\lfloor \mathcal T \rfloor \mathtt{*x} \mid \text{\(\mathcal T\) at \(x\) accepts an even-length word }\big\}
    \]
    Show that \(L\) is undecidable.
</div>

<div class="exercise">
    <b>(Empty Language Problem)</b>
    The language below consists of all encodings of Turing machines (and states) that do not recognize any words.
    \[
        L_\emptyset = \big\{\lfloor \mathcal T\rfloor \mathtt{*x} \mid \mathcal R(\mathcal T, x) = \{\}\big\}
    \]
    Show that \(L_\emptyset\) is undecidable.
</div>

<div class="exercise">
    <b>(Equivalence Problem)</b>
    The language below consists of all pairs of encodings of Turing machines (and states) that recognize exactly the same words.
    \[
        L_= = \big\{\lfloor \mathcal T_1\rfloor \mathtt{*x_1\#}\lfloor \mathcal T_2\rfloor \mathtt{*x_2} \mid \mathcal R(\mathcal T_1, x_1) = \mathcal R(\mathcal T_2, x_2)\big\}
    \]
    Show that \(L_=\) is undecidable.

<h3>Rice's Theorem</h3>

<p>
    You might have noticed that all of these undecidable problems are of a similar flavour: they're all "about machines".
    This is not a coincidence, as the theorem we are about to state shows. 
    It's called Rice's Theorem, named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Gordon_Rice">Henry Gordon Rice</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The theorem requires some terminology to state precisely.
