<h1>A Pumping Lemma for Context-free Languages</h1>

<p>
    Let's start with a simple exercise.
</p>

<div class="exercise">
    <b>(Knowing you ABCs)</b>
    Let \(A = \{a,b,c\}\).
    Try to design a context-free grammar with a variable that derives the language 
    \[
        L = \{a^nb^nc^n \mid n \in \mathbb N\}
    \]
    What got in your way?
    Now design the simplest algorithm you can for deciding whether a given word \(w \in A^*\) is in \(L\).
    What kinds of things did you need in the algorithm?
</div>

<p>
    Something got in your way. 
    What was it?
    Well, as you might be able to glean from the tone of that exercise, it is not possible to recognize \(\{a^nb^nc^n \mid n \in \mathbb N\}\) with a context-free grammar (or equivalently, with a sytack automaton).
    This language lies outside of \(\mathsf{CFL}\)!
