<h1>Timing Turing Machines</h1>

<p>
    In the previous part of the course, we discovered the <i>Turing machine</i>, a powerful model of computation that mimics the bit-writing-and-rewriting operations of modern hardware.
    It was a mathematical model of computation, which allowed us to give an "upper-bound" on the power of computing as a whole: it showed us that there are computational problems that <i>cannot be solved algorithmically</i>.

    But what about the problems that <i>can</i> be solved algorithmically?
    We are now ready for Part 4 of this story, which has less to do with whether or not a given computational problem <i>can be solved at all</i>, and more to do with <i>how many resources it takes to solve the problem</i>.
    This is what's known as the <i>complexity</i> of the problem.
