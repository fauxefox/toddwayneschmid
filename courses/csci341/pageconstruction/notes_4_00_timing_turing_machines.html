<h1>Timing Turing Machines</h1>

<p>
    In the previous part of the course, we discovered the <i>Turing machine</i>, a powerful model of computation that mimics the bit-writing-and-rewriting operations of modern hardware.
    It was a mathematical model of computation, which allowed us to give an "upper-bound" on the power of computing as a whole: it showed us that there are computational problems that <i>cannot be solved algorithmically</i>.
</p>

<p>
    But what about the problems that <i>can</i> be solved algorithmically?
    We are now ready for Part 4 of this story, which has less to do with whether or not a given computational problem <i>can be solved at all</i>, and more to do with <i>how many resources it takes to solve the problem</i>.
    This is what's known as the <i>complexity</i> of the problem.
    Studying complexity with Tureing machines precisely requires precise definitions of <i>time</i> and <i>space</i> as resources.

<h2>Timing Tape Programs</h2>

<p>
    Our model for the memory of a computer was the <i>tape machine</i>, which we defined to be a pair \((t, i)\) consisting of a <i>tape</i> \(t \colon \mathbb Z \to A \cup \{\_\}\)  and a <i>position</i> \(i \in \mathbb Z\).
    Tape machines came with a notion of <i>tape program</i>, and we defined these with a grammar that allowed us to write sequences of the basic commands \(\mathtt{move~right}\), \(\mathtt{move~left}\), and \(\mathtt{write~\sigma}\), where \(\sigma \in A\).
    Now, it is a bit hard to say how much time each of these basic commands takes to run, given they are abstract entities.
    In particular, we don't know the <i>units</i> of time to measure with. 
    Our fundamental assumption going forward is that <i>each of these basic tape machine commands takes about the same amount of time to run</i>.
    This allows us to use the amount of time that a basic tape machine command to run <i>as our unit of time</i>.
    This reduces measuring the time taken by a particular tape program to simply counting the number of basic tape machine commands get run.

<div class="definition">
    <b>(Tape Program Runtime)</b>
    Let \(p \in \mathtt{Tape}\) be a tape machine program. 
    Then the <i>runtime of \(p\)</i>, written \(\mathsf{rtime}(p)\), is the number of basic tape machine commands that appear in \(p\).
    More formally, 
    <ol>
        <li>\(\mathsf{rtime}(\mathtt{move~left}) = \mathsf{rtime}(\mathtt{move~left}) = \mathsf{rtime}(\mathtt{move~right}) = 1\)</li>
        <li>If \(p,q \in \mathtt{Tape}\), then \(\mathsf{rtime}(p{.}q) = \mathsf{rtime}(p) + \mathsf{rtime}(q)\)</li>
    </ol>
