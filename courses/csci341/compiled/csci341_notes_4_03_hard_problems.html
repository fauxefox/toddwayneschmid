<p>
    Finding a resource-intensive solution so a problem is not evidence that the problem is difficult. 
    For example, the problem of sorting an array can be solved in various dumb ways: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort" target="_blank">bogosort</a>, at one end, runs in \(\mathcal O(n!)\)-time, and merge sort at the other runs in \(\mathcal O(n\log(n))\)-time.
    Sorting ain't that bad!
</p>

<p>
    Big-O analysis of worst-case runtime is a sort of upper-bound on the difficulty of an algorithmic problem.
    Once we find an algorithm for solving a problem in \(\mathcal O(f)\)-time, we know that it is "at most \(\mathcal O(f)\)-difficult".
    This opens up the possibility of beating that time, thereby showing that the problem is not as hard as we thought.
</p>

<p>
    On the other hand, Big-\(\Omega\) analysis gives a lower bound on the (typically worst-case) running time of an algorithm. 
    But with Turing machines, complexity is a bit fuzzier: translating between a Turing machine and a physical computer is not always linear, and the Church-Turing thesis in particular does not directly make any observation about the complexity of translating between different versions of the deterministic Turing machine (like multi-tape and multiple-to-one-symbols; both of which take \(\mathcal O(n^2)\)-time).
    This fuzziness was our motivation to consider the families \(\mathsf{P}\), \(\mathsf{NP}\), \(\mathsf{EXP}\), and so on.
    In this lecture, our goal is to give a useful lower-bound on the complexity of an algorithm in this fuzzy paradigm of complexity classes.

<h2>Hardness</h2>

<p>
    The intuitive notion of "one problem is harder than another", as many of you have probably discovered by now, has to do with reductions. 
    What we learn from a reduction \(L_1 \preceq L_2\) (i.e., there exists a reduction \(r \colon L_1 \preceq L_2\)) is that \(L_2\) was the "harder" problem: any solution to \(L_2\) is enough to solve the "easier" problem \(L_1\).
    This relation \(\preceq \subseteq 2^{A^*}\) is a kind of "relative hardness" measure for problems. 
    This is where the following terminology comes from.
</p>

<div class="definition">
    <b>(\(\mathsf{Fam}\)-Hardness)</b>
    Let \(\mathsf{Fam} \subseteq 2^{A^*}\) be any family of languages, and let \(L \subseteq A^*\) be a language. 
    We say that \(L\) is <i>\(\mathsf{Fam}\)-hard</i> if for any \(U \in \mathsf{Fam}\), there is a polynomial time reduction \(r \colon U \preceq L\).
</div>

<p>
    So, for example, a decision problem is <i>\(\mathsf{P}\)-hard</i> if it has a polynomial time reduction from every tractible problem.
    The broader class of \(\mathsf{NP}\)-hard problems get a special name because they are the prime focus of the \(\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{NP}\) problem mentioned last time.
</p>

<div class="definition">
    <b>(Hard Problems)</b>
    A decision problem (i.e., language) \(L \subseteq A^*\) is generally called <i>hard</i> if \(L\) is \(\mathsf{NP}\)-hard.
</div>

<p>
    A lot of your favourite problems are hard, unfortunately.
    Many puzzle and videogames have been shown to be \(\mathsf{NP}\)-hard, including 
    <ul>
        <li>Sudoku</li>
        <li><a href="../compiled/csci341_notes_1_00_games_and_state_diagrams.html" target="_blank">Sokoban</a></li>
        <li>Rush Hour</li>
        <li>Battleship</li>
        <li>Majhong</li>
        <li>...(and many others)</li>
    </ul>
    What this means is that any algorithm for deciding whether a particular configuration of the puzzle (of arbitrary size---these results often generalize the game so that the game board can be arbitrarily large) has a solution <i>at all</i> can be used to solve any other computational problem in \(\mathsf{NP}\) with only a polynomial amount of added runtime.
</p>

<p>
    Directly showing that a decision problem is \(\mathsf{NP}\)-hard is so difficult that some of the most fundamental results of the field are proofs of this form.
    What is more typical is to show that a problem is \(\mathsf{NP}\)-hard by exhibiting a polynomial time reduction to another problem that is \(\mathsf{NP}\)-hard.
</p>

<div class="theorem">
    <b>(Hardness by Reduction)</b>
    Let \(\mathsf{Fam} \subseteq 2^{A^*}\) be a family of languages, and let \(L \subseteq A^*\) be \(\mathsf{Fam}\)-hard. 
    Suppose that we had another language \(W \subseteq A^*\) and a polynomial time reduction \(r \colon L \preceq W\).
    Show that \(W\) is also \(\mathsf{Fam}\)-hard.
</div>

<div class="problem">
    <b>(Proving Hardness by Reduction)</b>
    Prove the Hardness by Reduction theorem.
</div>

<h2>Completeness</h2>

<p>
    A slightly more confusing property of a problem with respect to a complexity class is <i>completeness</i>.
</p>

<div class="definition">
    <b>(\(\mathsf{Fam}\)-completeness)</b>
    Let \(\mathsf{Fam} \subseteq 2^{A^*}\) be a family of languages. 
    A language \(L \subseteq A^*\) is said to be <i>\(\mathsf{Fam}\)-complete</i> if \(L \in \mathsf{Fam}\) and \(L\) is \(\mathsf{Fam}\)-hard.
</div>

<p>
    Many of the puzzle games mentioned at the top are in fact \(\mathsf{NP}\)-complete, in addition to be \(\mathsf{NP}\)-hard.
    In a moment, we will discuss (probably) the most influential example of an \(\mathsf{NP}\)-complete problem.
    A long list of \(\mathsf{NP}\)-complete problems <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NP-complete_problems" target="_blank">can be found on Wikipedia</a>.
</p>

<div class="remark">
    One common misconception about \(\mathsf{NP}\)-complete problems is that they must have the most complex solutions imaginable: "if \(L \subseteq A^*\) is an \(\mathsf{NP}\)-complete decision problem that can be verified in \(\mathcal O(n^{5})\)-time, does that mean that there are no decision problems in \(\mathsf{NP}\) that require slower than \(\mathcal O(n^5)\)-time solutions?"
    The answer to this question is, of course, no.
    Completeness speaks of there being a polynomial-time reduction, and does not mention the runtime of that reduction: perhaps every reduction \(\mathcal S_y \colon U \preceq L\) from a given language \(U \subseteq A^*\) runs in \(\mathcal O(n^{17})\)-time. 
    Then the algorithm you obtain by composing the reduction with your verifier for \(L\) will run in \(\mathcal O(n^{17} + n^5) = \mathcal O(n^{17})\)-time as well.
</div>

<h2>Hard/Complete Problems</h2>

<p>
    We are now going to consider a few hard/complete problems.
</p>

<h3>The Travelling Salesman Problem</h3>

<p>
    A <i>weighted directed graph</i> is a pair \(\mathcal G = (X, \to)\) consisting of a set \(X\) of \emph{nodes} and a relation \({\to} \subseteq X \times \mathbb N \times X\) of \emph{weighted edges}.
    Given nodes \(x,y \in X\), the <i>cost of travel along a path</i> 
    \[
        P = (x \xrightarrow{c_1} x_1 \xrightarrow{c_2} \cdots \xrightarrow{c_n} x_n = y)
    \] 
    is the sum \(\mathsf{cost}(P) = \sum_{i = 1}^n c_i\).
    A <i>tour</i> of a (weighted) directed graph is a path 
    \[
        T = (x_0 \xrightarrow{c_1} x_1 \xrightarrow{c_2} x_2 \xrightarrow{c_3} \cdots \xrightarrow{c_n})
    \]
    such that \(X = \{x_0, x_1, \dots, x_n\}\).
</p>

<div class="definition">
    <b>(Travelling Salesman Decision Problem)</b>
    The <i>travelling salesman decision problem</i> is the decision problem 
    \[
        \mathit{TSDP} = \{(\mathcal G, k) \mid \text{there exists a tour \(T\) of \(\mathcal G\) with \(\mathsf{cost}(T) \le k\)}\}
    \]
</div>

<p>
    The travelling salesman decision problem is known to be \(\mathsf{NP}\)-complete.
</p>

<div class="theorem">
    <b>(TSDP is NP-complete)</b>
    The travelling salesman decision problem is \(\mathsf{NP}\)-complete.
</div>

<p>
    The proof of hardness is somewhat beyond us for now, but I'm sure you can figure out the completeness.
</p>

<div class="exercise">
    <b>(TSDP is NP)</b>
    Show that the travelling salesman decision problem is in \(\mathsf{NP}\).
