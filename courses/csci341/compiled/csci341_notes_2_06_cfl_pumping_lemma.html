<p>
    Let's start with a simple exercise.
</p>

<div class="exercise">
    <b>(Knowing you ABCs)</b>
    Let \(A = \{a,b,c\}\).
    Try to design a context-free grammar with a variable that derives the language 
    \[
        L_{abc} = \{a^nb^nc^n \mid n \in \mathbb N\}
    \]
    No really, give it a good go.
    What got in your way?
</div>

<p>
    Something got in your way. 
    What was it?
    Well, as you might be able to glean from the tone of that exercise, it is not possible to recognize \(\{a^nb^nc^n \mid n \in \mathbb N\}\) with a context-free grammar (or equivalently, with a sytack automaton).
    This language lies outside of \(\mathsf{CFL}\)!
    <img src="../imgs/Chomsky_Heirarchy_2.svg" />
</p>

<p>
    But don't take my word for it. 
    We are going to spend today developing a technique for proving that a given language is <i>not</i> context-free.
    Taking some inspiration from the last time we showed that a language was not in a particular family, 
    we are going to establish a property that every context-free language satisfies but \(L_{abc}\) does not.
    In fact, the property itself looks a lot like the previous one, too.
    Not every context-free language has a <i>pumping length</i> (for eg., \(\{a^nb^n \mid \mathbb N\}\))... but what about a <i>double pumping length</i>?
</p>

<div class="definition">
    <b>(Double Pumping Length)</b>
    Let \(L \subseteq A^*\) be any language. 
    A <i>double pumping length for \(L\)</i> is a number \(\ell \in \mathbb N\) such that for any word \(w \in L\) with \(|w| \ge \ell\), there exist five words \(u_1, u_2, u_3, p_1, p_2 \in A^*\) that satisfy the following properties:
    <ol>
        <li>\(w = u_1 p_1 u_2 p_2 u_3\) (\(w\) breaks up into \(u_1, u_2, u_3, p_1, p_2\))</li>
        <li>either \(p_1 \neq \varepsilon\) or \(p_2 \neq \varepsilon\) (at least one of the <i>pumps</i> is nonempty)</li>
        <li>\(|p_1 u_2 p_2| \le \ell\) (the middle section has at most \(\ell\) letters)</li>
        <li>for any \(k \in \mathbb N\), \(u_1p_1^k u_2p_2^k u_3 \in L\) (\(p_1\) and \(p_2\) can be simultaneously pumped)</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<p>
    There are a lot of moving parts here, so let's take a look at an example. 
</p>

<div class="example">
    <b>(Pumped ABs)</b>
    Let's return to considering the language \(L_{ab} = \{a^nb^n \mid n \in \mathbb N\}\).
    This language has a double pumping length, but we are going to come back to that number later.
    Instead, let's consider a concrete word \(aabb \in L_{ab}\). 
    We can break this word into five words like the ones described in the definition of double pumping length:
    \[\begin{gathered}
        aabb = u_1p_1u_2p_2u_3 \\
        \text{where above, } 
        \quad
        u_1 = a
        \quad 
        p_1 = a
        \quad 
        u_2 = \varepsilon
        \quad 
        p_2 = b
        \quad 
        u_3 = b
    \end{gathered}\]
    Property 1 holds, clearly.
    Property 2 asks us to check that either \(p_1 \neq \varepsilon\) or \(p_2 \neq \varepsilon\).
    This is of course true, because \(p_1 = a \neq \varepsilon\). 
    Property 4 asks us to check that \(p_1\) and \(p_2\) can be <i>simultaneously pumped</i>. 
    This is true! 
    Watch: for any \(k \in \mathbb N\), 
    \[
        u_1 p_1^k u_2 p_2^k u_3 = a~a^k~\varepsilon~b^k~b = a^{k+1}b^{k+1} \in L
    \] 
    The property we left out has to do with the double pumping length iteself---the number!
    
    <p></p>
    If you pay close attention, you should notice that \(u_1 = a\) and \(u_3 = b\) could be replaced by \(a^j\) and \(b^j\), respectively, without affecting the rest of the properties. 
    This is a huge hint: the number \(\ell = 2\) is a double pumping length for this language!
    To see why, let \(w = a^nb^n\) be any word in \(L_{ab}\) such that \(|a^nb^n| \ge 2\).
    Then \(n \ge 1\), so we can find a number \(j \in \mathbb N\) such that
    \[
        w = a^j~a~b~b^j
    \]
    Now we can choose \(u_1,p_1,u_2,p_2,u_3\) like before:
    \[\begin{gathered}
        a^jabb^j = u_1p_1u_2p_2u_3 \\
        \text{where above, } 
        \quad
        u_1 = a^j
        \quad 
        p_1 = a
        \quad 
        u_2 = \varepsilon
        \quad 
        p_2 = b
        \quad 
        u_3 = b^j
    \end{gathered}\]
    Properties 1, 2, and 4 hold for the same reason as before, and 
    \[
        |p_1u_2p_2| = |a \varepsilon b| = |ab| = 2 \ge 2 = \ell
    \]
    This shows that \(2\) is a double pumping length for \(L_{ab}\).
</div>

<div class="exercise">
    <b>(Finding Double Pumps)</b>
    Find double pumping lengths for the following three languages.
    <ol>
        <li>\(L_1 = \{a^nb^{2n} \mid n \in \mathbb N\}\)</li>
        <li>\(L_2 = \{a^nb^{m}c^{n+m} \mid n,m \in \mathbb N\}\)</li>
        <li>\(L_3 = \{ww^{op} \mid w \in A^*\}\) (these are the even length palindromes)</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<p>
    As you might have expected, every context-free language has a double pumping length.
</p>

<div class="theorem">
    <b>(Double Pumping)</b>
    Every context-free language has a double pumping length. 
    More precisely, if \(L \in \mathsf{CFL}\), then there is a number \(\ell \in \mathbb{N}\) such that \(\ell\) is a double pumping length for \(L\).
</div>

<p>
    We will talk about the proof a little bit later---the proof makes use of parse trees, actually.
    For now let's get a bit of practice using the Double Pumping Theorem in.
</p>

<div class="example">
    <b>(ABCs Ain't Context-free)</b>
    We are going to use the Douple Pumping theorem to show that \(\{a^nb^nc^n \mid n \in \mathbb N\}\) is not context-free.
    Given an arbitrary \(\ell \in \mathbb N\), let \(w = a^\ell b^\ell c^\ell\).
</div>

<div class="exercise">
    <b>(Reruns)</b>
    Use the Double Pumping Theorem to show that the following languages are not context-free.
    <ol>
        <li>\(L_1 = \{w \in \{a,b,c\}^* \mid \text{\(w\) has the same number of \(a\)s, \(b\)s, and \(c\)s}\}\)</li>
        <li>\(L_2 = \{a^n b a^n b a^n \in n \in \mathbb N\}\)</li>
    </ol>
